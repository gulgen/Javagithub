## Project Description

### **FlightTicketPriceCalculator**

This program takes necessary data from the user to calculate the flight ticket price and applies various discounts to calculate the total ticket price. Based on the user's input, the following calculations are made:

1. **Distance**: The base price of the ticket is calculated based on the distance (in kilometers) provided by the user.
2. **Age**: Discounts are applied based on the user's age. The following age-based discounts are applied:
    - 0-12 years old: 50% discount
    - 13-24 years old: 10% discount
    - 65 years or older: 30% discount
3. **Trip Type**: The user selects either one-way or round-trip. A 20% additional discount is applied for round-trip travel.
